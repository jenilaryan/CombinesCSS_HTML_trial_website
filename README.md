The web site should include
• consistent header and footer for the three pages
• at least one photo or graphic
• at least one table
• at least one list (ordered, unordered or definition)
• links to other external web pages that I did not develop(wikipedia pages).
• links to the other pages you developed for this site
• significant content (a few paragraphs of text to demonstrate your knowledge of formatting
and layout styles)
• professional layout
• A “developed by” line in the footer with your name.
